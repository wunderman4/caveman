# Caveman Help

Display this reference card when invoked. One-shot — do NOT change mode, write flag files, or persist anything. Output in caveman style.

## Modes

| Mode | Trigger | What change |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **Lite** | `/caveman lite` | Drop filler. Keep sentence structure. |
| **Precise** | `/caveman precise` | Drop filler. Keep articles. Named nouns, exact verbs. Zero ambiguity. |
| **STE200** | `/caveman ste200` | Precise + ASD-STE100 controls: one instruction per sentence, active voice, no noun stacks, one verb per operation. Default. |
| **Full** | `/caveman full` | Drop articles, filler, pleasantries, hedging. Fragments OK. |
| **Ultra** | `/caveman ultra` | Extreme compression. Bare fragments. Tables over prose. |
| **Wenyan-Lite** | `/caveman wenyan-lite` | Classical Chinese style, light compression. |
| **Wenyan-Full** | `/caveman wenyan` | Full 文言文. Maximum classical terseness. |
| **Wenyan-Ultra** | `/caveman wenyan-ultra` | Extreme. Ancient scholar on a budget. |

Mode stick until changed or session end.

## Skills

| Skill | Trigger | What it do |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| **caveman-commit** | `/caveman-commit` | Terse commit messages. Conventional Commits. ≤50 char subject. |
| **caveman-review** | `/caveman-review` | One-line PR comments: `L42: bug: user null. Add guard.` |
| **caveman-compress** | `/caveman-compress <file>` | Compress .md files to caveman prose. Saves ~46% input tokens. |
| **caveman-help** | `/caveman-help` | This card. |

## Deactivate

Say "stop caveman" or "normal mode". Resume anytime with `/caveman`.

## Language

Keep user's language by default. User write Portuguese → reply Portuguese caveman. Compress the style, not the language. Technical terms, code, commands, commit types, and exact error strings stay verbatim unless user ask for translation.

## Configure Default Mode

Default mode = `ste200`. Change it:

**Environment variable** (highest priority):
```bash
export CAVEMAN_DEFAULT_MODE=ultra
```

**Config file** (`~/.config/caveman/config.json`):
```json
{ "defaultMode": "lite" }
```

Set `"off"` to disable auto-activation on session start. User can still activate manually with `/caveman`.

Resolution: env var > repo-local config > user config file > `ste200`.
